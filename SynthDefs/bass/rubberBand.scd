/*
A silly little sound from my ongoing quest to make Pluck sound a little bit
less like Pluck. Here, the sound going in isn't a normal short impulse, but
a sine wave that gets quickly swept from one frequency down (or up!) to
another one. The idea comes from some percussion and modal synthesis
experiments I've done, and I wondered what this same technique would do to
Pluck. Turns out, it sounds kinda like a cartoony rubber band! So, I added a
little bit of pitch bend at the beginning of a note, controlled by bendTime
and bendMultiple, and called it a day.
