Modifications from the original include:

-Added Vibrato.ar, to better simulate left hand movement alongside the pre-existing pwm.
-Changed ASR envelope to ADSR and "scratch" envelopes, to simulate the attack of a bow.
-Added filters, to simulate tone brightening from the bridge and back of the instrument.

Modified by Bruno Ruviaro and Josh Mitchell 8/19.
